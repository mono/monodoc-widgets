Monodoc.Widgets is a library of Gtk# widgets to display and edit
monodoc documentation catalogs.

Building:
--------

The standard autotools process:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Subversion users substitute autogen.sh for configure and must have
automake and autoconf installed.

Hacking:
--------

Anyone wishing to help with the effort should state their intentions on
mono-docs-list prior to starting.  Development is very brisk ATM, and
code duplication makes the maintainer cranky, especially when there is 
so much work to be done.
