	* initial checkin.  DocTree widget is feature-complete for
	on-disk catalog navigation.  Layout and Painting in DocView with
	limited Mouse event forwarding to the item hierarchy.  Items include
	a generic LabelItem, HeadingItem, and LinkItem. A BannerItem with 
	heading and links to parent docs. A MarkupItem which handles raw text
	and simple markup like see/paramref/typeparamref. KitchenSinkItem
	which will eventually handle the tangled mess of nested para/code/SPAN
	and so on elements.  And SummaryTableItem which handles the
	Name/Summary tables seen on Namespace, Type, Members, and Ctor/Method
	pages.  Node pages implemented so far are the toplevel Catalog node
	and the Namespace node.
